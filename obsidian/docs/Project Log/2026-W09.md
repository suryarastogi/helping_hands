---

- **Hand (2026-02-28):** Implemented `claudecodecli` hand updates — applied latest CLI backend behavior and wired through finalization workflow.
- **Hand (2026-02-28):** Added cron-scheduled submission tasks via `ScheduleManager` + RedBeat with server CRUD endpoints (#52).
- **Hand (2026-03-01):** Documentation reconciliation pass: created `active/PRD.md` for tracking doc improvements, added missing MkDocs API doc pages (`task_result`, `skills`, `command`, `web`), updated `mkdocs.yml` nav and `docs/index.md` cross-references.
- **Hand (2026-03-01):** Added Google-style docstrings to ~15 undocumented methods across `base.py`, `iterative.py`, and `model_provider.py` — improves mkdocstrings API reference output.
- **Hand (2026-03-01):** Updated README and AGENT.md timestamps to 2026-03-01; reconciled Obsidian Project Log with current week (W09).
- **Hand (2026-03-01):** Created `active/PRD.md` for test coverage & documentation quality improvements. Added 40-test comprehensive test suite for `filesystem.py` (path traversal prevention, symlink escape, read/write/mkdir/exists). Added Google-style docstrings to ~20 undocumented CLI hand methods across `claude.py`, `codex.py`, `goose.py`, `gemini.py`, and `base.py`. Reconciled obsidian docs with current state.
- **Hand (2026-03-01):** Production robustness & E2E hardening: wrapped all GitHub API calls in `github.py` with `GithubException` handling and actionable error messages. Added E2E branch collision handling, draft PR mode (`HELPING_HANDS_DRAFT_PR`), and PR idempotency guard (`find_open_pr_for_branch`). Added `Config.__post_init__` validation for repo format and model name patterns. Updated TODO.md E2E hardening item.
- **Hand (2026-03-01):** API validation hardening & documentation reconciliation: added `BuildRequest`/`ScheduleRequest` input validation bounds (`min_length`, `ge`/`le` constraints, cron expression syntax validation via croniter). Added `logging.warning` with `exc_info` to health check exceptions for production observability. Added `Config.__post_init__` docstring. Populated obsidian `AGENT.md` with conventions summary. Reconciled docs across all surfaces.
- **Hand (2026-03-01):** Test coverage expansion & robustness hardening: added 22 `ScheduleManager` unit tests (CRUD, enable/disable, record_run, trigger_now) with mocked Redis/RedBeat. Added 15 Celery helper tests (`_redact_sensitive`, `_github_clone_url`, `_repo_tmp_dir`, `_trim_updates`, `_append_update`, `_UpdateCollector`). Added 30 skills payload runner validation tests. Fixed `_run_bash_script()` to reject empty payloads. Added `default_prompts.py` MkDocs API page. Total: 449 tests passing.
