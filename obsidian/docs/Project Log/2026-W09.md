- **Hand (2026-02-27):** Implemented `goose` CLI backend with auto-derived `GOOSE_PROVIDER`/`GOOSE_MODEL`, `--with-builtin developer` injection, `GH_TOKEN`/`GITHUB_TOKEN` mirroring, and disabled local GitHub auth fallback. Wired through CLI, app UI, and Celery routing.
- **Hand (2026-02-27):** Implemented `geminicli` CLI backend with `--approval-mode auto_edit` default, model unavailability retry, and heartbeat/idle-timeout guards. Wired through CLI, app UI, and Celery routing.
- **Hand (2026-02-28):** Added cron-scheduled submission tasks via RedBeat (`server/schedules.py`): `ScheduleManager` CRUD, cron presets, manual trigger, and `scheduled_build` Celery task. Exposed via REST endpoints in `server/app.py`.
- **Hand (2026-02-28):** Added rich PR description generation (`pr_description.py`): CLI-tool-backed title+body output with fallback to generic body template.
- **Hand (2026-02-28):** Reconciled docs, docstrings, and Obsidian notes: fixed CLAUDE.md hand-to-file mapping, marked stale TODO.md items as done, added goose/gemini/scheduling to Architecture and Concepts, added MCP to Vision, created mkdocs stubs for `schedules.py`/`task_result.py`, added scheduling API to docs/index.md, updated README project tree, and recorded recent decisions in AGENT.md.
