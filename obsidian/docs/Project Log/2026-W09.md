- **Hand (2026-02-28):** Added Goose CLI backend (`goose`) with auto-injected `GOOSE_PROVIDER`/`GOOSE_MODEL`, `--with-builtin developer`, and `GH_TOKEN`/`GITHUB_TOKEN` mirroring; wired through CLI, app UI, and Celery routing.
- **Hand (2026-02-28):** Added Gemini CLI backend (`geminicli`) with `--approval-mode auto_edit`, deprecated-model retry, and heartbeat support; wired through CLI, app UI, and Celery routing.
- **Hand (2026-02-28):** Refactored all CLI hand backends to share a common two-phase subprocess base (`cli/base.py`) with streaming, heartbeat, and idle timeout.
- **Hand (2026-02-28):** Added cron-scheduled task support via RedBeat + Redis: CRUD endpoints (`/schedules/*`), `scheduled_build` Celery task, and a schedules UI tab in the dashboard.
- **Hand (2026-02-28):** Added rich PR description generation (`pr_description.py`) using CLI tools to produce descriptive titles/bodies from git diffs during finalization.
- **Hand (2026-02-28):** Reconciled docs, docstrings, and Obsidian vault: fixed CLAUDE.md class-to-file mapping for hands, updated Obsidian Architecture/Concepts with goose/gemini/cron/exec-tools/native-auth, marked completed TODO items, added W09 log entry, and updated AGENT.md recurring decisions.
