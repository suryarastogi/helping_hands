- **Hand (2026-02-28):** Reconciled docs, docstrings, and Obsidian vault. Updated Architecture.md and Concepts.md with goose/geminicli CLI backends, ollama provider, and cron-scheduled submissions via RedBeat. Updated TODO.md to mark all CLI backends as implemented. Added missing docstrings to `Hand.__init__`, `AIProvider.__init__`, and `E2EHand.run`. Created MkDocs pages for ollama provider, task_result, and schedules modules. Added ollama, redbeat, goose/geminicli, and scheduled-tasks entries to AGENT.md recurring decisions and dependencies table.
