- **Hand (2026-02-28):** Added cron-scheduled submission tasks (`server/schedules.py`) using RedBeat for Redis-backed cron persistence, with CRUD endpoints, preset expressions, enable/disable, and manual triggers.
- **Hand (2026-03-01):** Reconciled docs, docstrings, and Obsidian vault. Updated TODO.md (marked completed CLI backends, routing, streaming, PR descriptions, scheduling), CLAUDE.md (architecture: pr_description, scheduling, provider details), AGENT.md (new deps, recurring decisions, fixed pyproject.toml reference), README (project structure: schedules.py, pr_description, model_provider), mkdocs.yml + docs/index.md (added schedules and ollama pages), Obsidian Architecture/Concepts/Project todos (added goose/geminicli backends, scheduling, PR description concepts). Added missing docstrings to key public Hand methods.
