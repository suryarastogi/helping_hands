---

- **Hand (2026-02-28):** Reconciled docs, docstrings, and Obsidian vault. Added missing `ollama` provider page to MkDocs and nav. Updated Obsidian Concepts/Architecture to include `ollama` and CLI backend data flow. Expanded class docstrings for `Hand`, `_TwoPhaseCLIHand`, `_BasicIterativeHand`, all four CLI hand classes, and `E2EHand` to describe contracts, extension points, and backend-specific behaviors. Updated Obsidian `Project todos.md` design notes with CLI backend base class and recent completion entries. Updated `docs/index.md` to list individual provider pages.
- **Hand (2026-02-28):** Second reconciliation pass across docs, docstrings, and Obsidian. Fixed CLAUDE.md hand-to-file mappings (`BasicLangGraphHand`/`BasicAtomicHand` are in `iterative.py`, not `langgraph.py`/`atomic.py`). Added missing MkDocs pages for `command.py`, `web.py`, `schedules.py`, `task_result.py`. Updated README project structure tree with `command.py`, `web.py`, `model_provider.py`, `pr_description.py`. Updated Obsidian Architecture layers and MCP tool lists to include command/web tools. Updated Obsidian Concepts system tools reference. Added `types` link to `docs/index.md` AI providers list.
