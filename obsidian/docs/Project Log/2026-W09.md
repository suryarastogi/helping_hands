## Progress

- **Hand:** Reconciled docs, docstrings, and obsidian vault (2026-02-28)
  - Fixed CLAUDE.md hand listing to correctly distinguish iterative hands (`iterative.py`) from non-iterative hands (`langgraph.py`, `atomic.py`)

  - Updated Obsidian Architecture.md: added `goose`/`geminicli` to CLI mode, app mode, and data flow; added Goose/Gemini CLI backend requirements; added scheduled tasks section; expanded system tools and hand backend listings
  - Updated Obsidian Concepts.md: expanded CLI backend semantics to cover all four CLI backends (`codexcli`, `claudecodecli`, `goose`, `geminicli`); added `ollama` to provider list; added Skills and Scheduled tasks concepts
  - Updated TODO.md: marked Claude CLI, Gemini CLI, Goose CLI, and streaming as implemented; added cron-scheduled tasks item; updated backend routing and CLI hand scaffold entries
  - Updated Obsidian Project todos.md with design notes for goose, geminicli, skills, cron scheduling, and implementation status
  - Updated docs/index.md API reference links: added ollama provider, command/web tool pages, task_result server module; added skills and scheduling to runtime flow
  - Created missing MkDocs API doc stubs: `ollama.md`, `command.md`, `web.md`, `task_result.md`
