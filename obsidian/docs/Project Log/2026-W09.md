- **Hand (2026-02-28):** Reconciled docs, docstrings, and Obsidian vault. Added missing `ollama` provider page to MkDocs and nav. Updated Obsidian Concepts/Architecture to include `ollama` and CLI backend data flow. Expanded class docstrings for `Hand`, `_TwoPhaseCLIHand`, `_BasicIterativeHand`, all four CLI hand classes, and `E2EHand` to describe contracts, extension points, and backend-specific behaviors. Updated Obsidian `Project todos.md` design notes with CLI backend base class and recent completion entries. Updated `docs/index.md` to list individual provider pages.
