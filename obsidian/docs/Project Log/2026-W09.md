- **Hand (2026-02-28):** Reconciled docs, docstrings, and Obsidian vault. Fixed config.py module docstring (TOML → defaults), updated AGENT.md dependency table reference (requirements.txt → pyproject.toml), added goose/geminicli coverage to Architecture.md and Concepts.md, added ollama to provider wrapper lists, expanded MCP tool inventory in Architecture.md, checked off completed TODO.md items (Claude CLI, Gemini CLI, Goose CLI, full backend routing, CLI streaming), and added missing docstrings to CLI hand base and iterative hand modules.
