- **Hand (2026-02-28):** Reconciled docs, docstrings, and Obsidian vault. Fixed stale references across CLAUDE.md (corrected `BasicLangGraphHand`/`BasicAtomicHand` file locations from `langgraph.py`/`atomic.py` to `iterative.py`), TODO.md (marked `claudecodecli`, `geminicli`, `goose`, full routing, CLI streaming, and cron scheduling as completed), Architecture.md (added `goose`/`geminicli` backends, cron scheduling section, and `GooseCLIHand`/`GeminiCLIHand` to app data flow), Concepts.md (added `goose`/`geminicli` semantics, `ollama` provider, and cron-scheduled tasks concept), and Project todos.md (added goose/geminicli/scheduling design notes). Updated weekly progress index.
