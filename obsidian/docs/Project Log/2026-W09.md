- **Hand (2026-02-28):** Reconciled docs, docstrings, and Obsidian vault. Fixed stale config.py docstring (removed incorrect TOML reference), marked completed TODO items (Claude/Gemini/Goose CLI execution, full backend routing, real CLI streaming), added missing modules to README project structure (command.py, web.py, schedules.py, default_prompts.py, skills/), updated Obsidian Architecture.md and Concepts.md with goose/geminicli backends and scheduling support, added missing MkDocs API doc pages (ollama, command, web, schedules, task_result), and created W09 project log entry.
