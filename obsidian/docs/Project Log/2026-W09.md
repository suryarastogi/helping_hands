Progress and contributions for this week. Add entries below; tag with **User** or **Hand** so we know who contributed.

---

- **Hand (2026-02-28):** Implemented `goose` CLI backend with auto-derived `GOOSE_PROVIDER`/`GOOSE_MODEL`, `--with-builtin developer` injection, `GH_TOKEN` mirroring, and full subprocess streaming.
- **Hand (2026-02-28):** Implemented `geminicli` CLI backend with `--approval-mode auto_edit`, model unavailability retry, `GEMINI_API_KEY` auth, and full subprocess streaming.
- **Hand (2026-02-28):** Added dynamic skills system (`lib/meta/skills/`) with composable tool bundles (`execution`, `web`, `prd`, `ralph`); legacy `enable_execution`/`enable_web` flags fold into skills automatically.
- **Hand (2026-02-28):** Added cron-scheduled build tasks via RedBeat + croniter (`server/schedules.py`); full CRUD `/schedules` REST API + built-in app UI for schedule management.
- **Hand (2026-02-28):** Expanded system tools layer: added `lib/meta/tools/command.py` (Python/Bash execution) and `lib/meta/tools/web.py` (search/browse) alongside existing `filesystem.py`.
- **Hand (2026-02-28):** Reconciled docs, docstrings, and Obsidian vault: updated README, CLAUDE.md, AGENT.md, TODO.md, docs/index.md, mkdocs.yml, and Obsidian Architecture/Concepts/Project todos notes to reflect all current features (goose, geminicli, skills, schedules, expanded tools layer).
