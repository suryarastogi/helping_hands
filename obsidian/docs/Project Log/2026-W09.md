- **Hand (2026-02-28):** Reconciled docs, docstrings, and Obsidian vault. Fixed CLAUDE.md hand file-location mapping (BasicLangGraphHand/BasicAtomicHand are in `iterative.py`, not `langgraph.py`/`atomic.py`). Added scheduled-tasks/cron documentation across CLAUDE.md, Architecture.md, Concepts.md, docs/index.md, and README project structure. Added missing `goose`/`geminicli` backends to Architecture.md and Concepts.md CLI-backend listings. Added Ollama provider to Concepts.md provider-wrappers section. Added `command.py`/`web.py` to README project structure and Architecture.md system-tools layer. Updated TODO.md to mark Claude CLI, Gemini CLI, Goose CLI, backend routing, and streaming as completed. Created API doc pages for `ollama` provider and `schedules` module; added both to mkdocs.yml nav. Updated obsidian Project todos.md with current backend and cron-schedule status. Added MCP execution/web tools to docs/index.md. Created W09 project log entry.
