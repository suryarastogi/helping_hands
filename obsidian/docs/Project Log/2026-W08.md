# Week of 17–23 Feb 2026

Progress and contributions for this week. Add entries below; tag with **User** or **Hand** so we know who contributed.

---

- **Hand:** Set up Obsidian docs: [[Home]], [[Vision]], [[Concepts]], [[Architecture]], and this weekly progress system. Created [[Project Log/Weekly progress]] to describe format and [[Project Log/2026-W08]] as first week note. (Session: initial docs build.)
- **Hand (2026-02-22):** Hardened E2E CI integration semantics. Live E2E push/update now runs only on `master` + Python `3.13`; non-primary matrix jobs run dry-run to avoid concurrent PR branch push races.
- **Hand (2026-02-22):** Extended GitHub PR update flow for E2E runs. Added PR body refresh and marker-based status comment upsert so resumed PRs keep original description in sync with latest run timestamp/commit/prompt.
- **Hand (2026-02-22):** Added `ty` to dev/pre-commit checks and documented current baseline (`src` scope with targeted ignores for optional-backend noise), while preserving Ruff checks.
- **Hand (2026-02-22):** Implemented basic iterative hands (`basic-langgraph` / `basic-atomic`) with streamed iteration output, interruption support, inline file edit parsing, and default final PR behavior.
- **Hand (2026-02-22):** Added explicit side-effect control (`--no-pr`), owner/repo auto-clone support in non-E2E CLI runs, and token-authenticated non-interactive push configuration to avoid OS credential popups.
- **Hand (2026-02-22):** Reconciled README, TODO, AGENT, docs index, and Obsidian architecture/concepts notes to match current runtime behavior.
- **Hand (2026-02-22):** Refactored `lib/hands/v1/hand.py` into a package module (`lib/hands/v1/hand/`), added shared system filesystem tooling in `lib/meta/tools/filesystem.py`, exposed matching filesystem operations via MCP tools, and updated module-level docstrings/docs to describe module purpose and interface relationships.
- **Hand (2026-02-22):** Added `lib/ai_providers/` wrapper package (`openai`, `anthropic`, `google`, `litellm`) and hand model-provider adapter resolution so hands use provider wrappers instead of hard-coded provider clients.
- **Hand (2026-02-22):** Switched default OpenAI-family model to `gpt-5.2`; basic iterative hands now preload iteration-1 context from repo `README.md`, `AGENT.md`, and a bounded file-tree snapshot.
- **Hand (2026-02-22):** Enabled coverage reporting with `pytest-cov`, added CI `coverage.xml` upload to Codecov (Python 3.12 job), and added a coverage badge in README.
- **Hand (2026-02-22):** Hardened app-mode monitoring: added no-JS auto-refresh monitor endpoint (`/monitor/{task_id}`), improved UI polling resilience/caching behavior for `/tasks/{task_id}`, and added Celery URL fallbacks/defaults to reduce stale-task monitoring failures.
- **Hand (2026-02-22):** Improved monitor-view readability by fixing task/status/update/payload panel dimensions and moving overflow to in-cell scroll; reconciled README/docs/obsidian notes with current UI defaults and monitor behavior.
