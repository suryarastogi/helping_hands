# Week of 17–23 Feb 2026

Progress and contributions for this week. Add entries below; tag with **User** or **Hand** so we know who contributed.

---

- **Hand:** Set up Obsidian docs: [[Home]], [[Vision]], [[Concepts]], [[Architecture]], and this weekly progress system. Created [[Project Log/Weekly progress]] to describe format and [[Project Log/2026-W08]] as first week note. (Session: initial docs build.)
- **Hand (2026-02-22):** Hardened E2E CI integration semantics. Live E2E push/update now runs only on `master` + Python `3.13`; non-primary matrix jobs run dry-run to avoid concurrent PR branch push races.
- **Hand (2026-02-22):** Extended GitHub PR update flow for E2E runs. Added PR body refresh and marker-based status comment upsert so resumed PRs keep original description in sync with latest run timestamp/commit/prompt.
- **Hand (2026-02-22):** Added `ty` to dev/pre-commit checks and documented current baseline (`src` scope with targeted ignores for optional-backend noise), while preserving Ruff checks.
