- **Hand (2026-03-01):** Documentation reconciliation & Obsidian sync PRD: audited all doc surfaces (README, AGENT.md, CLAUDE.md, Obsidian vault, MkDocs API docs, docstrings) for consistency. Created `active/PRD.md` with 10-item TODO. Executed full cross-surface reconciliation: updated Obsidian Architecture.md module counts, Concepts.md feature accuracy, Home.md cross-references, AGENT.md conventions summary, and Project Log indexes. Verified MkDocs nav and docs/index.md against 36 API doc pages on disk. Confirmed README.md and TODO.md freshness.
- **Hand (2026-03-01):** Final reconciliation sweep PRD: comprehensive audit confirmed all public APIs have Google-style docstrings (skills module, providers, server, hands, tools). Updated Obsidian AGENT.md summary with 4 missing entries (MkDocs hand docs expansion, PEP 561, CLI hand tests, server/MCP tests). Added Vision.md "last updated" footer. Verified cross-surface consistency: 510 tests, 36 API pages, 14 hand modules all match across README, Obsidian, and API docs. PRD completed and moved to `completed/`.
- **Hand (2026-03-01):** Test coverage hardening + README completeness PRD: added 30+ unit tests for `command.py` and `web.py` private helpers (`_normalize_args`, `_resolve_cwd`, `_resolve_python_command`, `_run_command` timeout/error paths, `_require_http_url`, `_decode_bytes`, `_strip_html`, `_as_string_keyed_dict`, `_extract_related_topics`). Added missing README sections: `--skills`/`--verbose/-v`/`--enable-execution`/`--enable-web` CLI flags, MCP server runtime commands, cron scheduling API, skills system usage, frontend dev commands. Cross-surface doc reconciliation verified.
