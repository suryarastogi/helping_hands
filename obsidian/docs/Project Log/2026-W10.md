- **Hand (2026-03-01):** Documentation reconciliation & Obsidian sync PRD: audited all doc surfaces (README, AGENT.md, CLAUDE.md, Obsidian vault, MkDocs API docs, docstrings) for consistency. Created `active/PRD.md` with 10-item TODO. Executed full cross-surface reconciliation: updated Obsidian Architecture.md module counts, Concepts.md feature accuracy, Home.md cross-references, AGENT.md conventions summary, and Project Log indexes. Verified MkDocs nav and docs/index.md against 36 API doc pages on disk. Confirmed README.md and TODO.md freshness.
- **Hand (2026-03-01):** Final reconciliation sweep PRD: comprehensive audit confirmed all public APIs have Google-style docstrings (skills module, providers, server, hands, tools). Updated Obsidian AGENT.md summary with 4 missing entries (MkDocs hand docs expansion, PEP 561, CLI hand tests, server/MCP tests). Added Vision.md "last updated" footer. Verified cross-surface consistency: 510 tests, 36 API pages, 14 hand modules all match across README, Obsidian, and API docs. PRD completed and moved to `completed/`.
- **Hand (2026-03-01):** Test coverage hardening + README completeness PRD: added 30+ unit tests for `command.py` and `web.py` private helpers (`_normalize_args`, `_resolve_cwd`, `_resolve_python_command`, `_run_command` timeout/error paths, `_require_http_url`, `_decode_bytes`, `_strip_html`, `_as_string_keyed_dict`, `_extract_related_topics`). Added missing README sections: `--skills`/`--verbose/-v`/`--enable-execution`/`--enable-web` CLI flags, MCP server runtime commands, cron scheduling API, skills system usage, frontend dev commands. Cross-surface doc reconciliation verified.
- **Hand (2026-03-01):** Docstring completion & documentation reconciliation PRD: added Google-style docstrings to 27 functions across 12 files — all 5 AI provider `_build_inner`/`_complete_impl` methods, 8 skills runner/parser functions, and 9 meta/tools helpers in `command.py` and `web.py`. Updated Obsidian Architecture.md, Concepts.md, Project todos.md, and AGENT.md to reflect 569 tests and full docstring coverage.
- **Hand (2026-03-01):** Type safety, docstring polish & cross-surface reconciliation PRD: fixed `LangGraphHand.__init__` type hints to use `Config`/`RepoIndex` (matching `AtomicHand`), added `_build_agent` docstrings in langgraph.py and atomic.py, added `GitHubClient.__enter__`/`__exit__` docstrings. Full cross-surface audit confirmed 569 tests, 36 API pages, 14 hand modules consistent across README, AGENT.md, Obsidian, and MkDocs.
- **Hand (2026-03-01):** CLI hand robustness, docstring gaps & doc reconciliation PRD: replaced bare `except Exception` with specific types in `claude.py`, added `_MAX_CLI_RETRY_DEPTH` guard to recursive retry in `base.py`, added Google-style docstrings to 20+ private methods across all CLI hands, added 10 tests for `stream()`, `interrupt()`, and `_terminate_active_process()` (579 total). Cross-surface doc reconciliation verified.
- **Hand (2026-03-01):** Exception specificity & doc reconciliation PRD: replaced 8 remaining bare `except Exception:` patterns — `RuntimeError` in `e2e.py` and `base.py` GitHub fallback paths, `Exception as e` with enriched log messages in 6 server health check/Celery inspect guards (`app.py`). Updated Obsidian Architecture.md and Concepts.md test counts (569 → 579). Full cross-surface doc reconciliation verified.
- **Hand (2026-03-01):** DRY validation utilities, finalize refactor & doc reconciliation PRD: extracted duplicated `_parse_str_list`/`_parse_positive_int`/`_parse_optional_str` from `iterative.py` (dead code) and `skills/__init__.py` into shared `lib/validation.py` module. Refactored 161-line `_finalize_repo_pr` into smaller helpers (`_push_with_non_interactive_env`, `_create_pr_from_branch`). Replaced last `except Exception` in `base.py` with specific `(OSError, KeyError, AttributeError)`. Reformatted `docs/index.md` from 1,438-char single line to structured multi-line list. Added inline regex pattern documentation to `iterative.py`. Created `docs/api/lib/validation.md` (37th API page), updated mkdocs.yml nav and docs/index.md. Cross-surface doc reconciliation verified.
- **Hand (2026-03-01):** Cross-surface doc reconciliation & packaging polish PRD: fixed API page count mismatches in Obsidian AGENT.md and Project todos.md (36 → 37). Added `[project.urls]` section to pyproject.toml (Homepage, Repository, Documentation, Issues). Added "Last updated" footer to Obsidian Home.md for consistency with other vault docs. Full cross-surface audit confirmed 37 API pages, 579 tests, 14 hand modules consistent across all documentation surfaces.
- **Hand (2026-03-01):** Obsidian completeness, PRD workflow & doc reconciliation PRD: created `active/` directory with `.gitkeep` for PRD workflow. Added `validation.py` to README project structure tree. Added validation utilities layer to Obsidian Architecture.md. Created Obsidian "Completed PRDs" index page cataloguing all 23 completed PRDs by date and theme. Updated Home.md with PRDs section and completed PRDs link. Added "Design documentation" section to README linking to obsidian vault, API docs, completed PRDs, AGENT.md, and CLAUDE.md. Updated Project todos.md with PRD workflow description. Final cross-surface audit verified all 5 surfaces consistent.
