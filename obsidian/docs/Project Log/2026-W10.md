- **Hand (2026-03-01):** Documentation reconciliation & Obsidian sync PRD: audited all doc surfaces (README, AGENT.md, CLAUDE.md, Obsidian vault, MkDocs API docs, docstrings) for consistency. Created `active/PRD.md` with 10-item TODO. Executed full cross-surface reconciliation: updated Obsidian Architecture.md module counts, Concepts.md feature accuracy, Home.md cross-references, AGENT.md conventions summary, and Project Log indexes. Verified MkDocs nav and docs/index.md against 36 API doc pages on disk. Confirmed README.md and TODO.md freshness.
- **Hand (2026-03-01):** Final reconciliation sweep PRD: comprehensive audit confirmed all public APIs have Google-style docstrings (skills module, providers, server, hands, tools). Updated Obsidian AGENT.md summary with 4 missing entries (MkDocs hand docs expansion, PEP 561, CLI hand tests, server/MCP tests). Added Vision.md "last updated" footer. Verified cross-surface consistency: 510 tests, 36 API pages, 14 hand modules all match across README, Obsidian, and API docs. PRD completed and moved to `completed/`.
- **Hand (2026-03-01):** Test coverage hardening + README completeness PRD: added 30+ unit tests for `command.py` and `web.py` private helpers (`_normalize_args`, `_resolve_cwd`, `_resolve_python_command`, `_run_command` timeout/error paths, `_require_http_url`, `_decode_bytes`, `_strip_html`, `_as_string_keyed_dict`, `_extract_related_topics`). Added missing README sections: `--skills`/`--verbose/-v`/`--enable-execution`/`--enable-web` CLI flags, MCP server runtime commands, cron scheduling API, skills system usage, frontend dev commands. Cross-surface doc reconciliation verified.
- **Hand (2026-03-01):** Docstring completion & documentation reconciliation PRD: added Google-style docstrings to 27 functions across 12 files — all 5 AI provider `_build_inner`/`_complete_impl` methods, 8 skills runner/parser functions, and 9 meta/tools helpers in `command.py` and `web.py`. Updated Obsidian Architecture.md, Concepts.md, Project todos.md, and AGENT.md to reflect 569 tests and full docstring coverage.
- **Hand (2026-03-01):** Type safety, docstring polish & cross-surface reconciliation PRD: fixed `LangGraphHand.__init__` type hints to use `Config`/`RepoIndex` (matching `AtomicHand`), added `_build_agent` docstrings in langgraph.py and atomic.py, added `GitHubClient.__enter__`/`__exit__` docstrings. Full cross-surface audit confirmed 569 tests, 36 API pages, 14 hand modules consistent across README, AGENT.md, Obsidian, and MkDocs.
- **Hand (2026-03-01):** CLI hand robustness, docstring gaps & doc reconciliation PRD: replaced bare `except Exception` with specific types in `claude.py`, added `_MAX_CLI_RETRY_DEPTH` guard to recursive retry in `base.py`, added Google-style docstrings to 20+ private methods across all CLI hands, added 10 tests for `stream()`, `interrupt()`, and `_terminate_active_process()` (579 total). Cross-surface doc reconciliation verified.
- **Hand (2026-03-01):** Exception specificity & doc reconciliation PRD: replaced 8 remaining bare `except Exception:` patterns — `RuntimeError` in `e2e.py` and `base.py` GitHub fallback paths, `Exception as e` with enriched log messages in 6 server health check/Celery inspect guards (`app.py`). Updated Obsidian Architecture.md and Concepts.md test counts (569 → 579). Full cross-surface doc reconciliation verified.
- **Hand (2026-03-01):** DRY validation utilities, finalize refactor & doc reconciliation PRD: extracted duplicated `_parse_str_list`/`_parse_positive_int`/`_parse_optional_str` from `iterative.py` (dead code) and `skills/__init__.py` into shared `lib/validation.py` module. Refactored 161-line `_finalize_repo_pr` into smaller helpers (`_push_with_non_interactive_env`, `_create_pr_from_branch`). Replaced last `except Exception` in `base.py` with specific `(OSError, KeyError, AttributeError)`. Reformatted `docs/index.md` from 1,438-char single line to structured multi-line list. Added inline regex pattern documentation to `iterative.py`. Created `docs/api/lib/validation.md` (37th API page), updated mkdocs.yml nav and docs/index.md. Cross-surface doc reconciliation verified.
