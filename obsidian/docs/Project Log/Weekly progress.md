# Weekly progress

A shared log of what happened each week on helping_hands. **Users** and **hands** (AI helpers) can both add entries so progress is visible and attributable.

## How it works

- Each week has one note: `YYYY-Www.md` (ISO week), e.g. `2026-W08.md`.
- The note is just a list of **entries**. No fixed schema—write a short line or a paragraph.
- Every entry should say **who** (you or a hand) and **what** (what was done or decided).

## Format for entries

Keep it simple. Two patterns:

**By a user (you):**
```text
- **User:** Short description of what you did or decided. (Optional: link to note or PR.)
```

**By a hand (AI):**
```text
- **Hand:** Short description of what the hand did. (Optional: "in session about X".)
```

You can add dates or timestamps if useful. Multiple entries per week are fine; newest at the bottom or top—pick one and stick to it for that week.

## Where to add

- **Current week:** Open the note for this week (see [[Project Log]] for "Latest") and add your entry.
- **New week:** Create `YYYY-Www.md` in this folder (e.g. `2026-W09.md`), add a level-1 heading with the week range, then add entries. Link it from [[Project Log]] under "Latest."
