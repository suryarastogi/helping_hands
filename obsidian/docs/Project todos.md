# Project todos

The canonical checklist lives in the repo root: **`TODO.md`**. This note is for design notes or decisions that affect the todos.

## Summary (from TODO.md)

1. **Set up Python project** under `src/helping_hands`:
   - **Layout:** `lib/` (core), `cli/` (CLI, uses lib), `server/` (app mode, uses lib)
   - **Tooling:** uv, ruff, `ty` type checking, pre-commit
   - **CI/CD:** Push/PR pipeline runs uv sync, tests, Ruff; E2E integration is opt-in and push-safe in matrix
   - **Tests:** pytest under `tests/`, run in CI

2. **Dockerise app mode and add Compose:** Dockerfile for the app; `compose.yaml` with main server, Celery workers, Redis, Postgres, and Flower.

3. **Autodocs generation and serving on GitHub:** Generate API docs from docstrings (e.g. Sphinx/MkDocs), build in CI, publish to GitHub Pages.

## Design notes

- E2E PR updates are now treated as **state refresh**: live runs update both PR body and marker comment with latest timestamp/commit/prompt.
- CI integration policy: only `master` + Python `3.13` performs live push/update; other matrix jobs force dry-run to avoid PR branch race conditions.
- Pre-commit now includes `ty` for type checks; current rule ignores are intentional until optional backend imports/protocol signatures are tightened.
- Basic iterative backends now default to a final commit/push/PR step; explicit `--no-pr` disables side effects (and maps to dry-run for E2E).
- Non-E2E CLI supports `owner/repo` input by cloning to temporary workspace before indexing/iteration.
- Hand internals were split from a single `hand.py` into a package module (`lib/hands/v1/hand/`); shared filesystem system tools now live in `lib/meta/tools/filesystem.py` and are also exposed via MCP filesystem tools.
- Provider routing is now centralized in `lib/ai_providers/` plus `lib/hands/v1/hand/model_provider.py`, replacing direct provider client construction in hands.
- Basic iterative hands now preload iteration-1 context from `README.md`, `AGENT.md`, and a bounded file-tree snapshot.
- CI and local test runs now include coverage reporting (`pytest-cov`), and README shows a Codecov badge.
- App-mode monitoring now supports both JS polling (`/tasks/{task_id}`) and a no-JS fallback monitor (`/monitor/{task_id}` with auto-refresh), reducing browser-dependent failures.
- Monitor UI now uses fixed-size task/status/update/payload cells with in-cell scrolling to keep layout stable during polling.
- `claudecodecli` now includes a one-time no-change enforcement pass for edit-intent prompts and defaults to non-interactive permissions skip (configurable), reducing "prose-only/no-edit" runs.
- `claudecodecli` command resolution now includes fallback to `npx -y @anthropic-ai/claude-code` when `claude` binary is unavailable; docs now call out that fallback requires network access in worker runtimes.
- Compose file is `compose.yaml` (not `docker-compose.yml`) and now sets default in-network Redis/Celery URLs for server/worker/beat/flower/mcp services when `.env` is sparse.
- `goose` and `geminicli` CLI backends are now fully supported in both CLI and app mode, with auto-derived provider/model env vars and backend-specific automation flags.
- App mode now supports cron-scheduled submission tasks via `/schedules` CRUD endpoints backed by RedBeat; each schedule defines a `BuildRequest` payload and a cron expression.
- MCP server now exposes execution tools (`run_python_code`, `run_python_script`, `run_bash_script`) and web tools (`web_search`, `web_browse`) alongside filesystem tools.
