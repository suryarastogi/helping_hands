# Project todos

The canonical checklist lives in the repo root: **`TODO.md`**. This note is for design notes or decisions that affect the todos.

## Summary (from TODO.md)

1. **Set up Python project** under `src/helping_hands`:
   - **Layout:** `lib/` (core), `cli/` (CLI, uses lib), `server/` (app mode, uses lib)
   - **Tooling:** uv, ruff, `ty` type checking, pre-commit
   - **CI/CD:** Push/PR pipeline runs uv sync, tests, Ruff; E2E integration is opt-in and push-safe in matrix
   - **Tests:** pytest under `tests/`, run in CI

2. **Dockerise app mode and add Compose:** Dockerfile for the app; `docker-compose.yml` with main server, Celery workers, Redis, Postgres, and Flower.

3. **Autodocs generation and serving on GitHub:** Generate API docs from docstrings (e.g. Sphinx/MkDocs), build in CI, publish to GitHub Pages.

## Design notes

- E2E PR updates are now treated as **state refresh**: live runs update both PR body and marker comment with latest timestamp/commit/prompt.
- CI integration policy: only `master` + Python `3.13` performs live push/update; other matrix jobs force dry-run to avoid PR branch race conditions.
- Pre-commit now includes `ty` for type checks; current rule ignores are intentional until optional backend imports/protocol signatures are tightened.
