# helping_hands — Docs

Design notes and progress for the **helping_hands** project. The repo README is the source of truth for what the tool does; this vault is for vision, design decisions, and ongoing updates.

## Project

- [[Vision]] — What we're building and why
- [[Concepts]] — Key ideas: hands, repo-awareness, AGENT.md, MCP, cron, skills
- [[Architecture]] — How the pieces fit (high-level; details in repo)
- [[Project todos]] — Checklist and design notes (canonical list: repo root `TODO.md`)

## Project Log

- [[Project Log]] — Weekly progress: how it works and where to add yours (latest week linked there)

**Users** and **hands** (AI helpers in this framework) can both add to the project log. See [[Project Log/Weekly progress]] for the format and conventions.
