# AGENT.md (repo root)

The agent guidelines for helping_hands live in the **repo root**, not in this vault.

→ [Open AGENT.md](../../AGENT.md)

If your vault is the whole project (e.g. `helping_hands` as root), that link may open the file. Otherwise open the repo in your editor or file manager and edit `AGENT.md` at the project root.
