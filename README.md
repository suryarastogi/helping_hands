# helping_hands

**AI-powered repo builder** — point it at a codebase, describe what you want, and let an AI agent help you build and ship features.

## What is this?

`helping_hands` is a Python tool that takes a git repository as input, understands its structure and conventions, and collaborates with you to add features, fix bugs, and evolve the codebase using AI. It can run in **CLI mode** (interactive in the terminal) or **app mode** (server with background workers).

### Modes

- **CLI mode** (default) — Run `helping_hands <repo>`. You work in the terminal; the hand streams responses and proposes edits. Best for local, interactive use.
- **App mode** — Runs a FastAPI server plus a worker stack (Celery, Redis, Postgres) so jobs run asynchronously and on a schedule (cron). Includes Flower for queue monitoring. Use when you want a persistent service, queued or scheduled repo-building tasks, or a UI.

### Execution flow

- **Server mode**: `server -> enqueue hand task -> hand executes`
- **CLI mode**: `cli -> hand executes`

For asynchronous runs, the hand UUID is the Celery task ID. For synchronous
runs, a UUID is generated by the hand. The working layout is:

`{hand_uuid}/git/{repo}`

The hand clones the repository there, makes code changes as the core side
effect, then pushes a branch and opens a GitHub pull request.
If `pr_number` is provided, the hand resumes that PR by committing/pushing to
its existing head branch instead of creating a new PR.
For CI commits, repo-local git identity defaults to:
`helping-hands[bot] <helping-hands-bot@users.noreply.github.com>`, overridable
via `HELPING_HANDS_GIT_USER_NAME` and `HELPING_HANDS_GIT_USER_EMAIL`.

### Key ideas

- **Repo-aware**: Clones or reads a local repo, indexes the file tree, and builds context so the AI understands what it's working with.
- **Conversational building**: Describe what you want in plain language. The agent proposes changes, writes code, and iterates with you.
- **Convention-respectful**: Learns the repo's patterns (naming, structure, style) and follows them in generated code.
- **Self-improving guidance**: Ships with an `AGENT.md` file that the agent updates over time as it learns your preferences for tone, style, and design.
- **E2E validation hand**: `E2EHand` is a minimal concrete hand used to test
  the full clone/edit/commit/push/PR flow.
